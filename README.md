# MAP583_project_16

In this project we propose to make a deep learning model to build real images from segmented masks.
We proceed with a deterministic approach. So we won't use GANs

# Data

we used images from the [Cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/dataset-overview/). These images are taken from roads of 50 cities in Germany and during different seasons of the year. This database consists of 5000 images, each of which has a mask. Each mask can have up to 30 different colors (30 classes).

To train our model, we chose NN images with their segmentation. 
These images and their masks are in `.png` format.
